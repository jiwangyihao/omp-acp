# omp-acp

`omp-acp` is an independent Agent Client Protocol adapter for the Oh My Pi coding agent.

The adapter is intended to run OMP as an ACP-compatible subprocess for editors such as Zed. It is not a long-lived fork of `pi-acp`; `pi-acp` and OpenCode ACP are reference implementations for behavior, tests, and compatibility checks.

## Design direction

- Keep ACP protocol handling separate from OMP runtime integration.
- Treat OMP behavior as the source of truth: launch `omp --mode rpc`, parse OMP RPC frames, and expose only capabilities that are actually implemented.
- Prefer tested OMP-native behavior over compatibility shims that silently mimic Pi semantics.
- Use `pi-acp` as a reference and selective patch source, not as a merge upstream.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run check
```

## Current status

This repository is at initial development stage. The package is marked `private` to prevent accidental publication before the ACP server is implemented and smoke-tested.
